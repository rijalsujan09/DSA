Time Complexity is measured how long  an algorithm   takes to run.
And It is usually Expressed in Big O notation.
And Big O  notation is a way of describing the asymptotic behaviour of the function.


       Big O Notation
        " how code slows as data grows "
        1. Describe the performance of an algorithm as the amount of the data increases
        2. Machine independent (# of the steps to completion)
        3. Ignore smaller operation O(n+1) -> O(n)

         example:    n = amount of data
         O(1)        (it's a variable like X)
         O(n)
         O(log n)
         O(n pow 2)
